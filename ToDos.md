# Open ToDos Snapshot (Expert Review Analysis System V2)

This file captures current open tasks to continue development toward a fully featured production release.

## ✅ Backend Analysis Pipeline (COMPLETED)

- [x] Audit backend methods (confirmed placeholder vs production-grade logic)
- [x] Implement review extraction layer (IMDb via BeautifulSoup, Steam via API, Metacritic via BeautifulSoup with User-Agent rotation and fallbacks)
- [x] Implement `filter_reviews` (dedupe, length threshold 20-5000 chars, spam pattern detection, repetition filtering)
- [x] Implement `summarize_reviews` (extractive summarization by keyword density and sentiment scoring)
- [x] Add theme vocabulary + similarity scoring (20 themes with keyword dictionaries, weighted scoring)
- [x] Implement sentiment alignment (normalized BERT mock scores aligned to user preferences)
- [x] Configurable model + thresholds via `.env` (Config class with MODEL_NAME, thresholds, rate limits)
- [x] Enforce rate limiting in `/api/analyze` with 429 handling and `retry_after`
- [x] Structured logging (JSON lines including `analysis_id`, `duration_ms`, `title`, `recommendation`)
- [x] Backend preference persistence (JSON-based PreferenceStore with full CRUD at `/api/preferences` and `/api/preferences/<id>`)

## Frontend Enhancements

- [ ] Dynamic loading states (progress/spinner for metrics and analyses)
- [ ] Accessibility pass (ARIA roles, focus trap in modal, toast announcements via `aria-live`)
- [ ] Theme system / dark mode (toggle + CSS variables)
- [ ] Export analysis report (download JSON/CSV of last analysis)

## Testing & Quality

- [ ] Unit tests (pytest) for: validator, theme similarity, sentiment alignment, summarization logic
- [ ] Integration tests (Flask test client for `/api/analyze`, `/api/metrics`)
- [ ] Frontend smoke tests (Playwright or Cypress – basic analysis flow)
- [ ] Performance profiling (timing decorators around critical pipeline sections)

## Deployment & DevOps

- [ ] Real BERT model download & caching layer
- [ ] Web scraping robustness (rotating User-Agent, backoff, error classification)
- [ ] Container healthcheck (Docker `HEALTHCHECK` command for `/api/health`)
- [ ] Centralized config object (merge `.env` + defaults) in Python
- [ ] CI pipeline (lint, tests, build image)

## Documentation

- [ ] Update README with scraping + model setup instructions
- [ ] Add API error codes section
- [ ] Architectural diagram (frontend modules + backend components)
- [ ] Contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)

## Future / Stretch

- [ ] Authentication & user accounts
- [ ] Preference syncing to backend
- [ ] Advanced NLP theme extraction (topic modeling / embeddings)
- [ ] Persistent analytics dashboard
- [ ] Multi-language support
